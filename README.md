# XZC
A programming language that understands raw english

in every release some new features will appear, release is published every 5 to 6 days.

Comparison (No offense)

XZC:
```XZC
declare name with "sadik"
declare names with ["john", "carl"]

writeln "$names"

insert name into names

writeln "$names"
```

Python 
```python
name = "sadik"
names = ["john", "carl"]

print(names)

names.append(name)

print(names)
```

see the difference, its readability not speed or output
