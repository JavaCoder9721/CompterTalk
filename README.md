ComputerTalk have nlp english -like syntax which makes it easier to read

## Comparison 

python:
```python
a = input("Enter a float: ")
b = int(a)
print(b)
```

ComputerTalk:
```Abap
define var a with take input: Enter a float
define var b with convert to int a
write b
```


## examples:
func:
```abap
define func sayhello
sayhello- hello!
call  sayhello
```
```abap
define func sum
sum- sum of 37 and 38
define func diff
diff- diff of 18 and 3
define func mul
mul- multiply 40 by 5
define func div
div- div 48 by 2
call sum
call diff
call mul
call div
```

comments:
    
```abap
comment: This is a comment
```

String manipulation:
    
```abap
print the length of <text>
length of <text> without spaces
```

loops:
    
```abap
repeat <times> times :
    hello
    sum of 4 and 3
    diff of 2 and 1
    product of 3 by 2
    divide 3 by 3
```

conditional statements:
    
```abap
comment: this is only a example
if <condition> Then hello
or <condition> Then hi
otherwise bye
```

arithmetic and scientific operations:
```abap
import math
comment: Normal ones:

sum of 193 and 298
diff of 182 and 838
multiply 3 by 80
div 4 by 3

comment: with vars

define var a with 4
define var b with 5
define var c with 12
define var d with 71
sum of a and 4
sum of 4 and a
diff of b and 3
diff of 3 and a
multiply c by 3
multiply 3 by c
div d by 2
div 2 by d

comment: scientific ones that needs math module

sin of 4
root of 2
round of 2
cos of 9

```
